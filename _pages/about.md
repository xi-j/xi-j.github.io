I am a PhD candidate at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.columbia.edu) and [Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu). I am a member of the [Neural Acoustic Processing Lab](https://naplab.ee.columbia.edu) supervised by Professor [Nima Mesgarani](https://nima.ee.columbia.edu). I build AI models and agents that listen and speak like humans. Recently, I am interested in how multimodal language models perceive and reason about the world, and how to better align them in behavior and in intention with human ears, eyes, and minds.

I am currently searching for 2026 research internships and collaborations.
